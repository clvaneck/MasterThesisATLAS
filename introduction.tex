\section{Introduction}
The effort to understand the fundamental structure of matter has driven scientific progress since the start of civilization. Ideas about the composition of matter have grown into the quantitative field of particle physics. Modern particle physics combines quantum field theory with large scale accelerator experiments capable of probing interactions beyond those accessible in any other scientific context. At the centre of this experimental program is CERN, where high-energy proton beams are brought into collision to study rare and energetic processes.
