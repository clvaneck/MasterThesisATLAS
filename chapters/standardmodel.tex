\chapter{The Standard Model}
The Standard Model, illustrated in figure \ref{fig:SM}, is a quantum field theory describing the known elementary particles and the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. Its structure is determined by the gauge symmetry
\begin{equation}
SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y},
\end{equation}
which contrains the interaction terms and fixes the form  of the Lagrangian. The strong interaction is governed by the non-Abelian colour group $SU(3)_{C}$, while the electroweak theory unifies the weak and electromagnetic forces through the groups $SU(2)_{L}$ and $U(1)_{Y}$.
